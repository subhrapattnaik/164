create the navmesh of our game scene, the position of each object has to be fixed.
But in the previous class we had random positions of the boxes.
First we need to fix the positions of these.

open gameObjects.js file.
We have two arrays px and pz to store x and z positions.
Guide the student to update the variables values using array index in the “boxes” component.


Now once the positions are fixed, let’s create the navmesh of the environment.
comment on the camera entity.


add the “inspector-plugin-recast” component and open Visual Inspector tool.


build the navmesh and to export the navmesh.
Guide the student to add it to the working folder and view the model in the gLTF viewer.



add it into <a-assets> and use the id to add it using “gltf-model”.



attach the nav-mesh component.
Guide the student to add the “movement-controls” and set the position and test the output.

adjust the dimensions of the boxes to avoid the gun model to enter into the box.


 give the id movement-controls entity and use that to adjust the bullet shooting position in the shoot.js file.
